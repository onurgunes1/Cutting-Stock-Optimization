# Cutting-Stock-Optimization
Cutting Stock Optimization
The aim of this project is to assist decision makers about the cutting stock problem. In my former company, raw materials that have a fixed length are cut for different dimensions. To be able to decrease the amount of scrap, different dimensions are combined. However, this arrangement is done by an operator and combinations are not the perfect match most of the time. This algorithm finds optimum combinations.
